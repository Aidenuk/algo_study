Binary Tree
binary tree is a tree where every node has at most 2 children (can have less than 
2 children, or no children at all)
ex:
    [], [None] -> is a valid binary tree

leaf node -> Node with no children, aka last node
root -> parent that has no arrows pointed at

Defining binary tree:
    - has at most 2 children
    - has exactly 1 root
    - has exactly 1 path between root and any node (unique path)

Time complexity: T = O(n)

graph allows cycle relationship
rule: n - 1

tree wont allow cycle relation ship
